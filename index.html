        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <h3>AI Learning Platform</h3>
        <p> Our team of 4 computer engineering students are developing a dynamic digital learning platform utilizing Large Language and Vision Models (LLMs and VLMs). The project aims to revolutionize education by providing personalized content based on user learning style and needs. Currently we have a mock interview page active that allows users to practice interviewing for specific job types.
        To check out our progress head to <a href="https://www.withagile.ai/" style="color: #0595fc;" target="_blank">AgileAI</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
        <p>I had the opportunity to take a computer vision course that delved into machine learning and neural networks. We designed, trained and tested a variety of generative and predictive models for many tasks. The models we studied and took inspiration from, were state of the art models the have won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in the past. 
        </p>

        <h3>Medulloblastoma Outcome Predictor</h3>
        <p>Medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor affecting mainly pediatric populations, poses significant challenges in terms of accurate clinical outcome prediction. In my studies I undertook the challenge of a re-analysis of gene expression data from the study by Pomeroy et al, "Prediction of central nervous system embryonal tumour outcome based on gene expression", Nature 2002, aiming to recreate and refine the predictive models for medulloblastoma clinical outcomes. The original study utilized a dataset comprising 60 patients, the goal was to enhance the predictive accuracy by employing  a weighted voting classifiers, using leave-one-out testing to optimize the model. Then evaluate it's performance using industry standard metrics. 
        Following iterative training and testing, the model with a combination of the highest Matthews' correlation coefficient Phi, lowest Fisher-exact P value, and highest accuracy was selected. Over 3000 models were trained and tested, the chosen model achieved a Phi value of 0.6748, P value of 0.00038 and an accuracy of 83.3% when making predictions on the test split.
        </p>

        <h3>Lower Body Exoskeleton</h3>
        <p> I was a member of Queen's Biomechatronics Team (QBMeT) which designed and constructed a powered load-bearing leg exoskeleton to reduce the mechanical load and improve the agility of firefighters. My sub-team was tasked with writing safe and efficient code to control the knee joint motors.
        </p>

        <h3>Simple RISC Computer</h3>
        <p>The goal of our group was to design, implement, simulate and verify a simple RISC
        Computer (Mini SRC) with the use of Quartus II (Verilog coding) and ModelSim-Altera (simulations). The
        computer would consist of a simple RISC processor, memory, and I/O. In phase 1, the
        focus was to create the required logic and simulating instructions such as add, sub, mul, div, and, etc., to
        design and functionally simulate a component of a Mini SRC datapath. Phase 2‚Äôs objective was to finish
        the Mini SRC datapath, which involved developing the Select & Encode logic, Memory subsystem, CON
        FF logic, Input/Ouput ports, and as well as instructions for different methods to be used. As the datapath
        portion of the Mini SRC has been designed and simulated to test its functionality at this point, Phase 3
        involves implementing and testing the Control Unit in Mini SRC.

          Fear is the mind-killer.<br>
          Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br>
          I will face my fear.<br>
          I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br>
          And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br>
          Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br>
          Only I will remain."<br>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>

        <p> While searching for jobs I found that most software related positions asked for examples of my work either in a website or code. Although I have worked on many interesting projects throughout my degree (some of which I talk about in here) I felt like I was missing something important. So I set out to create a website about me. But I wanted to make it stand out and be more than just a simple html page. That is when I looked up from my desk at the Solar System poster I have had for years. It has all the planets in order with tons of data about each one.
          So I paired my love for space with my interest in 3D rendering and animation to create something simple but fun! I attempted to make the planets size, rotation, and axis realtively accurate while maintaining a visually appealing site.
